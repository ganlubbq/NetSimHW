\section*{Exercise 1 - A discrete event queue simulator in MATLAB}
The discrete event queue simulator is based on the simulator proposed by Law in~\cite{law}. It is a simplified version of a more general DE simulator since it has to handle just one server and the events may be only arrivals or departures. In particular 

\section*{Exercise 2 - Read logs and analyze data}
In this second exercise the goal was to extract a look-up table from a log file of a simulator and use it to compute some measurements on useful quantities in underwater optical communications. In particular, the log files are obtained from the simulations of the ambient light irradiance $E_0$ with the simulator HYDROLIGHT. From the 3 different dump files (each for a different value of $c \in [0.15, 0.4, 2.19]$ with $c$ the attenuation coefficient) I recovered the values of $E_0$ and the corresponding depth $z$ in meters using a \texttt{perl} script. It uses a regular expression to identify the right rows of the log and selects the columns with the desired values. In Figure~\ref{fig:e0zm} $E_0$ is plotted as a function of the depth $z$.

\begin{figure}[h!]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width = 0.7\textwidth]{e0_z}
	\caption{Irradiance $E_0$ vs. $z$}
	\label{fig:e0zm}
\end{figure}

Some evaluation on the propagation are then carried out with a MATLAB script that uses the provided parameters for receiver and transmitter. The propagation model used the one proposed in~\cite{optmodel} and assumes that there is a successful transmission if the SNR is over a certain threshold. In particular from the irradiance and the parameters $S$ (sensitivity) and $A_r$ (area of the receiver) of the considered modem it is possible to compute the power of ambient light noise, which is $N_A = (S E_0 A_r)^2$. Let the received power $P$ be
\begin{equation}
	P = \frac{2 P_{tx} A_r \cos(\beta)}{\pi d^2 (1-\cos(\theta)) + 2 A_t}e^{-cd}
	\label{eq:p_opt}
\end{equation}
then the SNR is
\begin{equation}
	\Gamma  = \frac{(SP)^2}{2q(I_D + I_L)BW + \frac{4KTBW}{R} + N_A}
	\label{eq:snr_opt}
\end{equation}
In the following, if the SNR is above the threshold of 20 dB then there is a successful transmission. In particular, by setting the threshold and a distance $d = 10$ m, by inverting~\eqref{eq:snr_opt} in order to get $P$ and~\eqref{eq:p_opt} in order to compute $P_{tx}$ it is possible to know which is the minimum transmission power that can be used to reach a distance $d$. In Figure~\ref{fig:ptx}[a] there is the plot of the minimum $P_{tx}$ against the irradiance $E_0$, while in Figure~\ref{fig:ptx}[b] the x axis is the depth $z$ considered.

\begin{figure}[h!]
	\centering
	\subfigure[$P_{tx}$ to reach $d = 10$ m as a function of $E_0$]{\includegraphics[width = 0.45\textwidth]{ptx_e0}}
	\subfigure[$P_{tx}$ to reach $d = 10$ m as a function of $z$]{\includegraphics[width = 0.45\textwidth]{ptx_z}}
	\caption{Transmitted power $P_{tx}$ required to transmit at a distance of $d = 10$ meters}
	\label{fig:ptx}
\end{figure}

Finally, the transmit power is set to $P_{tx, max} = 100$ W and the maximum distance at which is possible to transmit is evaluated. Note that~\eqref{eq:p_opt} is not invertible with respect to the distance $d$, therefore the received power $P$ given by~\eqref{eq:p_opt} is precomputed for $d \in [0, 50]$ m and stored in a vector \texttt{P\_d}. Then, given a certain $E_0$, from~\eqref{eq:snr_opt} the minimum received power to guarantee an SNR of 20 dB is computed and the closest $P$ in \texttt{P\_d} is found. The corresponding value of $d$ is chosen as the maximum distance $d_{max}$ at which it is possible to transmit with $P_{tx, max} = 100$ W and that $E_0$ - or the corresponding $z$.

The results are in Figure~\ref{fig:dmax}.
